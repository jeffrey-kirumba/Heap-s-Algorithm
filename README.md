# Heap-s-Algorithm
An implementation of Heap's Algorithm I used to solve a homework question in my algorithms class.
This was the question:

Given an array "nums" of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You must return the permutations in an order such that any permutation can be obtained from the previous permutation  by swapping a single pair of elements.
